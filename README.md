# Addis GarrysMod Addons

This is a collection of addons for the game GarrysMod that have been created or are maintained by me.

## Purpose

This repo exists for you to either copy the code to edit it for your own needs and for you to suggest changes to me the easy way.

## Installation

To install any of these addons, please subscribe to them via [my Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/id/st_addi/myworkshopfiles/) or put them in your servers collection. The alternative would be to clone them into your ```[Path to GarrysMod]/garrysmod/addons/``` folder, however I do not recommend the latter.
